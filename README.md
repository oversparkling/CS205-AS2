# CS205 Assignment 2
This assignment required the use of Java concurrency concepts to manage threads of 4 different roles: a hotdog maker, hotdog consumer, burger maker and burger consumer. 
It involves the concepts of monitors and mutex control as the program has to ensure access/write to the Food buffer is controlled. 

On top of these, the program had to create a specified number of threads based on the input and also manage the priority of certain threads.
